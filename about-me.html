      <p class="about-me-text">My name is Viktor Bakai, I am 40 years old.
        I would like to work as a photographer in a studio as a photo retoucher, 
        studio photographer, assistant or something similar.
        I took two photography courses in a photo studio where I became richer with 
        a lot of information and experience. Since then, I have been continuously practicing 
        and developing myself in the field of photography, reading books and watching videos as well.
        I know and use Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom at a strong user level, I have learned 
        a lot about different lighting tools such as softboxes, screens and their setup, 
        light meter usage, light quality, properties, color temperature, etc.
        I became acquainted with portrait, building, macro, wildlife, architecture and object photography.
        I take a lot of pictures with my DSLR camera to practice and further develop myself in photography.
        I am fluent in English, I using it on a daily basis, mainly orally, sometimes in writing.
        I would really like and enjoy having the opportunity to meet new people every day in the studio 
        and see unexpected situations as a challenge, I would also improve myself in the field of sales.
        My goal is to work as a photographer in the future because I really like and enjoy doing it. 
        I am learning web development as well at the moment in HTML, CSS and Javascript languages. 
        I am able to create websites like this one.</p>
